# odin-recipes
First Project on Odin 
Looking to use HTML to create a brief recipes page with an additional webpage linked to it and use images. Hoping by the end to have a decent looking webpage despite online being in HTML. Will try to organize page considering how priority is assessed with bullet points and steps for the recipe.
